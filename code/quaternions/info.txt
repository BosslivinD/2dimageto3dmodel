We use quaternions in 3D Computer Graphics for simultaneous multiple axis rotation, instead of a sequential approach
with the use of matrix rotation.
For example, if we want to rotate 45 degrees about the xy-axis using the matrix rotation, we would need to first rotate
about the x-axis and then rotate about the y-axis (quaternions eliminate sequential flow).

Advantages of quaternions over matrix rotations:
1. Matrix rotations lose one degree of freedom in a 3D space when we rotate it sequentially
2. Quaternions are computationally more efficient (faster computation than matrices)

Quaternion representation.
q = [s, v] , where s is a scalar number and v is a vector that represents an axis.
Actually, quaternion is a sum of scalar and vector and q on itself is neither vector or scalar and allows us to
freely rotate the 3D object around a fixed axis.
